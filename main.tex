\section{Task Outline}
Using the step-by-step breakdown of your problems / solutions developed last week, identify technologies (programming languages, software libraries, APIs (Application programming interfaces, the means by which one program talks to another program) and other components of a modern data collection or processing workflow) that could accomplish each step. You may want to specify more than one possible technology. 


\noindent
In Scoping II I identified two patterns I wish to make easier. There were:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Finding specific words and sentences within and across different papers in an efficient manner
    \item Collecting and organizing papers into a single bibliographic database insuch a way that I can search for papers based on a theme.

\end{itemize}

\noindent
Depending on the software I can find, I may modify the second bullet point to make it a simpler goal for my PoC.


\section{General Notes}

I have looked into Voyant. It seems like a sufficient program for word and theme searches. 

I looked into Zotero. It seems like a sufficient program for referencing and as a bibliographic database. Alternatives include EndNote and Mendeley.
